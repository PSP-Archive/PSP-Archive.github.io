## TempGBA4PSP-mod

GameBoy Advance emulator, an unknown has just submitted a new version which brings some modifications on the basis of other emulators including gpSP and GPSP kai.

TempGBA4PSP-mod was created by [Phoenix](https://github.com/phoe-nix/), Anonymous Japanese Coder.

Based on this version [TempGBA4PSP-26731020](http://www1.axfc.net/uploader/so/3063963)

- Added gpsp kai 's cheats function.

- Added Chinese language.

- Added restore function.

- New menu icon.

- Doesn't support full screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

- Impoted code from TempGBA-mod-dstwo-26750220.

<h5>GBA BIOS</h5>

You need the actual BIOS files. <b>gba_bios.bin</b>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>
I have tested some games (Advance Wars 2, Golden Sun, Kingdom Hearts, Pokemon Fire Red) and this emulator seems to be the best one available
Yes I can also confirm that it runs Qwak, a game that didn't work at all in GPSP
TempGBA is supposed to have better compatibility / less glitches for some games than gpSP (e.g. Golden Sun). The speed, as far I could see back when I used gpSP is about the same.
As for the "GU" output, that's supposed to be accelerated video (=faster), whereas SW is software, which should probably be slower, although theoretically more accurate (less glitches). I use GU all the time though, and have yet to find a game that has any problem with it.

<h5>Controls</h5>
